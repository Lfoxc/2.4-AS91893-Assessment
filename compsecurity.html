  <p>Computer security is the protection of your computer’s network against viruses, theft or damage or destruction of hardware, software, and data, and information disclosure (leaked information). In a world that is frequently increasing their dependency on digital technologies, securing your computer is important because your computer is like a digital diary. You don’t want everybody to have access to your private information, nor do you want them to destroy, damage, steal, corrupt, or stop you from being able to access it.<br>

<br>In computer security there are three main objectives, commonly referred to as the AIC triad. The A stands for availability, which means users should be able to have access to their data whenever they want or need. Servers that store this data must be running at all times, otherwise users won’t be able to access their data. An example of this could be when a person needs to check their bank account online to see whether or not they have enough money to pay for groceries or for rent, but when they log in to view this data the server tells them that it is not available, or it just doesn’t load at all. The I stands for integrity; in addition to data needing to be available for users 24/7, it is equally important that this data is as accurate as possible and can’t be changed or deleted by anyone. Back to the online banking scenario; a person receives money from the government, at least $200, but when they log onto their bank account a few hours later instead of $200 the amount has now been reduced by $30 when the person didn’t purchase anything to change this. The C stands for confidentiality. Once again, your computer is your own private digital diary and it is important that whatever data is recorded in this diary is strictly confidential so that only you and - in some cases - authorised parties have access to it. If a network has a low rating for one or more of these objectives, it is likely that the network can’t be trusted, but, if a network has a strong or even full rating, it is a network that you can rely on to ensure your data is available when you need it, is accurate, and has no chance of being leaked.<br>

<br>In addition to ensuring the availability, integrity and confidentiality of your data, there are also many cybersecurity threats that you need to be aware of. Viruses - much like real life viruses - digital viruses infect a computer network through executable code tucked away in an interactive file, and can spread to other networks when that file is shared. Trojan horses - again, much like the real Trojan Horse in Troy - enters the computer in the appearance of something that can be installed into your computer. An example of this could be if someone downloaded a game. Similar to viruses, worms can occur when a user opens a link from an unknown source, most preferably in an email, it infects the computer, replicates itself, and finds ways to affect other computers working in the same network. The difference between viruses and worms is that to infect other computers with a virus you need to share the infected file, worms will find a way to infect other computers by itself. Spyware involves a third party stealing information by accessing files, webcams, and speakers. And, like spyware, keyloggers can obtain private information by recording everything the user types. And Ransomware locks the user out of a network or restricts their access to files until the ransom is paid. <br>

<br>These threats can be dealt with using network protection; proxy servers, UPS, firewalls, backup, and cloud backup. UPS stands for Uninterruptible power supply, and is often used whenever the main power supply goes out. The UPS works for a short amount of time, allowing servers to safely shut down so that data can’t be corrupted. Firewalls are designed to prevent unauthorised access to and from your computer and prevent private information from leaving, and intercepts viruses and other cyber threats from entering the cloud. Proxy servers can be used as an additional firewall, because it acts as a gateway between the user and the internet, and it provides control over content transferred through the proxy, and it keeps copies of sites frequently requested by the user. Backing up files and data on your computer involves making a copy of your data and storing it locally on some software. Backup files should be kept separate from the original data that is being stored, and should be kept in a secure location so that they can’t be accessed, deleted, damaged, or changed. The cloud backup is much more secure than regular backups, as it provides a backup copy if both physical copies are destroyed. Because most of the world relies heavily on technology, backing up data to the cloud is more common. <br>

<br>When deciding on a safe and secure password it is important to consider five things; the complexity of a password, the randomness of a password, the accessibility of private information secured in your computer, types of authentication, and whether or not this password is used on multiple sites and possibly devices. There are 96 characters that you can use in your password; 26 uppercase and lowercase letters, 10 numbers (0-9), and 34 special characters and symbols. And, because there are a total of 96 characters, this means that you can create different combinations of letters, numbers, and symbols. The randomness and the length of the password can also contribute to providing extra security, because the longer and randomer your password is, the harder it will be for people to guess your password, hack into your computer, and access important and private information. Using this password for one site and one device is also important because if you use the same password for different accounts and devices, if someone was able to figure out your password because the network security was low, then the attacker could easily log into your other accounts and devices and gain access to important information. A way that you can prevent this from happening is by using two-factor authentication. Two factor authentication makes use of using a password to secure your device, but it also uses a second form of authentication which could be facial recognition, or using your fingerprint. There are, however, ways that attackers can work around two-factor authentication such as using a photo of you if your second authentication is facial recognition. And with pattern authentication, if you hold your phone up to the light at a certain angle you can see the pattern your finger made when executing this pattern. <br>
