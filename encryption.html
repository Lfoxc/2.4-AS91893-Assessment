  <p>Encryption is the process of converting data into secret code, preventing unauthorized parties from being able to access it. In encryption there are two types of text; Plaintext and ciphertext. Plaintext is text that has not been encrypted into code, also known as ciphertext, which is text that has been encrypted using an algorithm and/or cipher. <br>

<br>The only way any authorised party can access this code is by using a secret key that only the people who are involved know. Much like how you need a specified house key to lock and unlock the door to your house, an encryption key does the exact same, except with your personal data and consists of a number between 1 and 25. If you’re on a digital device, and are exchanging information with one or more people, or accessing your data on a website that requires entering your personal details such as your credit card, name, address, etc, you are basically using an encryption-based system. This system takes the plaintext entered, converts it into ciphertext, and the person or site who is receiving this ciphertext, their computer will decrypt this code using the key, and convert the ciphertext back into plaintext.<br>

<br>The reason we need encryption is to prevent private information from being accessed and used by the wrong people for the wrong reasons. This includes preventing terrorists from accessing computer controlled interfaces and potentially controlling them. However, while the use of encryption is important, depending on the type of cipher being used it isn’t the most efficient. For example, if someone were to encrypt a plaintext message using Caesar Cipher and a hacker has the correct key, or are able to guess parts of the message judging by the repetition of some letters or the number of letters within a word, it would be easy for them to access crucial information being sent from one person to another. And, while a majority of encryption is used in order to secure private information, a lot of people use it in order to commit some form of illegal act without anyone picking up on it.<br>

<br>In addition to there being two different texts in encryption, there are also two different encryption keys; single-key encryption and public-key encryption. Single-key encryption involves the encryption of plaintext in which the key used to encrypt and decrypt the message are the same. Meanwhile, public-key encryption makes use of two keys of its own, also referred to as the public and private key. One key is used to encrypt a message (public key), while the other is used to decrypt said message (private key). If a person would use their correspondent’s public key to encrypt a message, only the correspondent will be able to decrypt it because they are the only ones who have access to the private key, the same rules apply vice versa. The same can also be said for encrypting a message with a private key. Similar to using a public key to encrypt and a private key to decrypt, doing the complete opposite is effective as the person who has access to the corresponding public key will be the only person who is able to decrypt it. Out of the two encryption keys, the public-key encryption is shown to be more reliable as it caters to the issue of both encryption and decryption using the same key and prevents one user needing to distribute the key in the first place, while single-key encryption has two faults. The first fault is that a great sense of trust is required between all parties involved, this is to ensure the information doesn’t reach anyone beyond them. The second is a matter as to how secure the interface used is so that the information shared isn’t accessed by anyone who isn’t involved. <br>

<br>There are a few different methods used to ensure confidentiality in encrypted code. One of these methods is called padding. Padding is extra data used to stop known plaintext attacks (an attack where an attacker knows a part or all of the substituted code, for example if the attacker knew you often start your emails/letters with ‘dear sir/madam’ they can determine what the rest of message says). If someone were to get a hold of both the ciphertext and the plaintext they wouldn’t be able to guess the values used because they won’t be able to compare their new encryptions to the original encryption. Another method would be to use a hashing algorithm. A hashing algorithm takes something the user has entered, like a password for example, and prints out a line of random characters, called hashes. The secret to a good hashing algorithm is that everytime a specific password is hashed it is represented using the same hash, and that with this specific hash it should be impossible to figure out the original password. Instead of storing the actual password, interfaces will actually store the hashed version of these passwords in order to prevent hackers from being able to use them. There is also another method, which is similar to both the hashing and padding algorithms, it’s called salting. Salting a password is to add extra data onto the end of a plaintext password. This is used in case an attacker were to figure out a person’s hashed password using the SHA-256 algorithm (also known as a dictionary attack, where attackers can gain access to a user’s personal information or a database/computer system through using a very large set of words to generate potential passwords). <br>

<br>A common cipher that is used in encryption is called caesar cipher. Caesar Cipher is a substitution encryption which sees each letter of a word rephrased into an entirely different letter using a number, or key. An example would be if I wanted to encrypt the word ‘Hello’ with a key of 18, ‘H’ would be ‘Z’, ‘E’ would be ‘W’, and so on. Caesar cipher is easy to decrypt once you know the key, so maybe by encrypting the ciphertext after encrypting plaintext it will make it slightly harder for attackers to decrypt despite knowing the key. This would be like encrypting the original plaintext message using a key of 36. The conversion table below shows which letter substitutes for which.</p>
