    <p>Error control involves detecting errors, correcting them if possible, and guarding against these errors from occurring in the first place. There are many different devices in which data can be stored in, such as internal and external hard drives, CDs, RAM, credit or debit cards, and barcodes. Errors can also occur in data that is being processed and transmitted between both wireless and wired networks, or through data that is being transmitted between RAM and hard drives.

The use of error control is important because without it, data can be corrupted, people can lose money, and can just make a person or a company's lives difficult. A real world example of errors having a devastating impact would be the crashing of a Turkish airlines flight on February 25th 2009, when an altimeter displayed an incorrect altitude, causing the plane’s autopilot feature to rapidly reduce its engine power so that the plane could meet this altitude, which lead to the plane crashing short of the runway of Amsterdam's Schiphol Airport. This crash led to the deaths of nine people.
<br>Errors in data can occur for three reasons; Human error, data decay, and transmission data corruption. Human error is when a person is entering data, they accidentally type in the wrong letter or number, forget to type in a letter or a number, or the positioning of one of the letters, numbers, or symbols have been switched. An example of this could be when you are typing in a password, and when you meant to type in the letter ‘a’, you type in the letter ‘s’ and as a result you will be told that the password you have entered is incorrect. Data decay occurs when the data in a system is lost and can gradually reduce the quality of the information it is stored in. An example of this would be to look at a digital image and flip the bits (i.e switching 0 with 1 and vice versa) used to create the image, the more bits that are flipped the more the quality of the image is reduced. It is similar to compressing an image into a Jpeg image several times. Transmission data corruption can occur due to disruptions in the transmission of data such as environmental issues which disrupt satellite transmissions, power outages, and the wi-fi being cut off or disconnected suddenly. This can cause the data to glitch or for some of the data to be missing. This can happen when a person is trying to transfer a video or a movie to their computer from another device, and the transmission or download is disrupted one or more times. The result of this will be the quality of the footage will be very low, with a lot of pixels being seen across the screen, and the audio might glitch and cut out from time to time too.
<br>Data can also be physically affected, too. This would include if a movie was being stored on a DVD and the DVD got scratched in a video player, or it was handled roughly.The footage on the DVD would glitch out when it is being played on a TV or a computer therefore disrupting the user from being able to watch the movie peacefully. A similar error can occur if a barcode is scratched, because this would result in store clerks having a difficult time being able to scan it properly. This leads them to have to type in the barcode themself, which can result in a human error, especially if one of the numbers is scratched out.
<br>There are many examples of error control that is used to detect and potentially correct errors, one of these examples is a checksum. Checksums are most commonly used on barcode scanners and credit card numbers to help ensure the product being scanned is the correct one and that the cost or charge that needs to be paid is charged to the right person. If the check digit is incorrect, a person can be incorrectly charged on or receive the wrong product. The check digit is the last digit on a barcode or credit card, and helps with the identification of accounts and products. The way to tell if a barcode is correct is by taking the first twelve numbers, multiplying every second number by three, adding the results up, round to the nearest ten, and subtracting the total from it. The remaining number should match the thirteenth number, also known as the check digit. The same rule applies to credit card numbers, except you multiply every second digit by two. Human error and physical problems are the main causes for errors in checksums.<br>Below are four different barcode numbers, however, one of the check digits is incorrect.
<br>Using the interactive below, or a calculator, pen or pencil, and paper, try to calculate which of the bar code are invalid.</p>
